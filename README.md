# SomeRecipes

[SomeRecipes](https://somerecipes.herokuapp.com/) is a web application for users to view and share recipes.  Inspired by AllRecipes, SomeRecipes allows users to create and review recipes, search for recipes, bookmark favorite recipes, and discover recipes by other users.

### Project Design

SomeRecipes was built in 10 days.  

A [proposal](https://github.com/joycechau/SomeRecipes/tree/master/docs) was drafted to help provide an implementation timeline during the development process.

A [database schema](https://github.com/joycechau/SomeRecipes/blob/master/docs/schema.md) was prepared alongside the design proposal.

### Future Implementations

Additional features to add include:
* Allowing users to specify public and private recipes
* Category filters
* Recipe recommendations
